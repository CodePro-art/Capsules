# **WEEKEND PROJECT**
#### APPLESEED PROGRAM PARTICIPANTS
*bootcamp capsules*

---

In my project I fetch data about the bootcamp participants from an api. This proccess is done twice because the data is scattered:
  * The first api gives the main data and the id's for the second fetch.
  * The second fetch makes use of th id's from the first fetch.

All the data is then stored into an array of objects (class named "Member").

I use local storage to save the data after every major change: 
* After fetching.
* After editing the data.
* After deleting of a row from the table.

The table has ascending/decending sorting mechanism. The user can apply the sorting by pressing on the relevant category.

The search bar contains a real time search algorithm that makes it easier to search for the wanted data from the table.
